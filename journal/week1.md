# Week 1 — App Containerization

This week was all about containers and its used cases.

### What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

### What is an IMAGE?
executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers – images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.


## Technical Task for Week 1 - Containerization

- ## create a github Repo
 The first tasked was to create a github repo of the AWS-Bootcamp-cruddur-2023 repo which container
 the backend and front apps folder that we would be working with.

 clicking the git pod button quickly took us to the gitpod envirnment, the environment began by running the `gitpod.yml` file which contain all th build configuration for the enviroment .
