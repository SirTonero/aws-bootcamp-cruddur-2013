# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week was all about containers and its used cases.

### What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

### What is an IMAGE?
executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers â€“ images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.


## Technical Task for Week 1 - Containerization

- ## create a github Repo
 The first tasked was to create a github repo of the AWS-Bootcamp-cruddur-2023 repo which container
 the backend and front apps folder that we would be working with.
 ![cruddur app repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112965272/220357778-c446591c-fc61-4d16-8a84-aa00c6b126ec.png)
 
 clicking the git pod button quickly took us to the gitpod envirnment, the environment began by running the `gitpod.yml` file which contain all th build configuration for the enviroment .
 
 - i updated my `gitpod.yml file` to get my environment ready with all the prerequisite installations
 
 find yaml belowðŸ‘‡
 
 ```yaml
 tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
  - name: postgress
    init: |
      curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
      echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" |sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-13 libpq-dev
  - name: initialise Frontend and Backend
    init: |
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/backend-flask
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      export BACKEND_URL="*"
      export FRONTEND_URL="*"
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
      npm i
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
vscode:
  extensions:
    - 42Crunch.vscode-openapi
    - cweijan.vscode-postgresql-client2
```

 ## Containerized Backend Flask APP
 
 ### Run python
 -  i change directory into the backend-flask folder
 -  exported the FRONTEND_URL and BACKEND_URL into our machine  ` The effect of not doing this means the backend wont connect to the front end `
 -  install python3 with flask and set a host and a port to listen on .
 
 ```sh
 cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
cd ..
```

### Output

- After running the above command we make sure we unlock the port in the port tab.ðŸ‘‡ <br>

- open the link with our specified port of `4567` in my browser
- append(to add to the end ) the url to `/api/activities/home`
- and voila we got back a json page with data

## Containerize our Backend-flask app

- cd into the `backend-flask`
- touch `dockerfile ` (no file extension is needed for a docker file)
- or create the dockerfile here like this in the vscode explorer pane: `backend-flask/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
 # Pulling this image from docker hub useing the FROM Command 
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Inside Container
# MAke a new container inside container
WORKDIR /backend-flask

# Outside Container -> inside Container
# this containers the library we want to install to run the app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# Inside Container
#install the python libraries used for the app
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Outside Container -> inside Container
# . means everything the current directory
# the first . - /backend-flask (outside container)
# the scond period ./backend-lask (inside container)
COPY . .

# Expose a port to listen to
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# CMD (command)
# python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]

```

## Build container 

```sh
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

## Run Container 

```sh
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
FRONTEND_URL="*" BACKEND_URL="*" docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it  -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask
unset FRONTEND_URL="*"
unset BACKEND_URL="*"
```

## Run the container in detach mode passing the `-d` flag

```sh
 docker container run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d backend-flask
```

## Get Container Images or Running Container Ids

```sh
docker images
docker ps
```
## Get all containers bot running and stopped

```sh
docker ps -a
```

## Check Container Logs
```sh
docker logs <container id> -f

docker logs backend-flask -f

## Check container Port

```sh
docker port <container id>
```

## passing a command into a running container

```sh
docker exec -it <container id> < example command > ps -aux
```

## Gaining shell access into a container 

```sh

docker exec -it <container id> sh 
```

## Delete a container

```sh
docker rm <container id>
```

## Deleting an image
```sh
docker rmi <image-name>
docker rmi backend-flask

```
 ## Containerized Frontend
 
 
 ## RUn NPM install
 NPM Install is required before building the container because it needs to copy the node_modules folder
 
 ```sh
 cd frontend-react-js
 npm i
 ```
 
 ### Create a Dockerfile
 
 create a dockerfile in the `frontend-react-js` folder
 `frontend-react-js/Dockerfile`
 
 i inserted the following instructions into my dockerfile
 
 ```dockerfile
# This command pull an image from registry with nodejs 
FROM node:16.18

# here we are setting the PORT for the APP
ENV PORT=3000

# we are copying the contents of the frontend-react-js into a created folder in the container call frontend-react-js
COPY . /frontend-react-js

# change the working directory to /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js

# The RUN Command install npm on the machine
RUN npm install

# exposes a port
EXPOSE ${PORT}

## cmd command here starts the NPM service
CMD ["npm", "start"]

```
 ## Build Container
 
 ```sh
 docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
 ```
 
 ## Run Container
 
 ```sh
 docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
 ```
 

- i made sure i opened the port using the steps found in the backend deployment

### We have our frontend-react-js App running (without data)
![SCR-20230221-oyr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112965272/220412531-e6cfe682-0728-4856-bf84-523fbbd2b520.png)


## Multiple containers 

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

## Create a docker-compose file 
### create a `docker-compose.yml` at the root directory of my project `/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023`

find below the docker-compose.yaml file which buillds our back end and frontend app together so they can connect .

```yaml

version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

## Running the docker-compose.yml file

Enter the command from From your project directory, start up your application by running

```sh

docker compose up

```

## Adding Postgres and DynamoDB Local

These are DB we would be using in a layer class hence we should install them now and add them to our docker compuse file


In future labs, we will use Postgres and DynamoDB locally. They can be brought in as containers and externally referenced.

In our existing Docker compose file, let's add the following:

### Postgres

```yaml

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes: 
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

To install the postgres client into Gitpod

```sh
  - name: postgres
    init: |
      curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
      echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" |sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-13 libpq-dev
```



### DynamoDB Local

```yaml
services:
  dynamodb-local:
    # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67533058/persist-local-dynamodb-data-in-volumes-lack-permission-unable-to-open-databa
    # We needed to add user:root to get this working.
    user: root
    command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"
    image: "amazon/dynamodb-local:latest"
    container_name: dynamodb-local
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
    working_dir: /home/dynamodblocal
    
```

## Volumes

directory volume mapping

```yaml
volumes: 
- "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
```

named volume mapping

```yaml
volumes: 
  - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```



# HomeWork CHallenge

- Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
- Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
- Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
- Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes. 


 ## Push and tag an image to docker HUb
 
 - i went to [docker hub website](https://hub.docker.com/)
 -  Created a free-tier account and verified my email addresss as well as chose a unique USername `Mrtonero`
 -  i created a repositiory to store my images
 ![SCR-20230221-wsd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112965272/220474590-3ee77c47-12ff-4203-adbb-a279791a3795.png)
 
 [my docker repositiory](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mrtonero007/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/general)
 
 - head over to my terminal and  typed
 ```sh
 docker login
 ````
 <img width="966" alt="SCR-20230221-x6e" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112965272/220477493-e71ccd89-b987-422d-8d99-a7bc8d261d6c.png">
 
 - i build the docker image to be pushed to my docker hub repository.

- then i tagged my image using the following commend 
```sh
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

docker tag backend-flask:latest mrtonero007/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023:week.
```
