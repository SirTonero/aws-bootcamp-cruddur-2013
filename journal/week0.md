## Recreate Logical Architectural Deisgn

#### LUCID allowed me to recreate the amazing cruddur app architectural diagram. I would like to introduce you to Lucid before I show you my diagram. Â <br> <br>Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming application that allows users to visually collaborate on drawing, revising and sharing charts and diagrams, and improve processes, systems, and organizational structures. It is produced by Lucid Software Inc.

## Installation and Setup of AWS CLI

#### The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

#### I was able to install the aws CLI and set it using my AWS Credentions on gitpod as well as well as my local terminal. <br> In order to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI. I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on Mac and Gitpod.

#### I took the following steps to install the AWS CLI by following the [Aws CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
